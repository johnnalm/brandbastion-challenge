```

## Usage Flow

1. **Upload Data**:
   - Click the + button or drag & drop PDF files
   - Paste comments directly into the chat input

2. **Ask Questions**:
   - Type analytical queries about your data
   - Examples: "What are the engagement trends?" or "How is user sentiment?"

3. **View Insights**:
   - See extracted metrics and trends
   - Review sentiment analysis results
   - Click suggested questions for deeper analysis

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend through `/api/chat`:

```typescript
// Request format
{
  message: "User's question",
  charts: ["PDF content or metadata"],
  comments: ["Comment 1", "Comment 2", ...]
}

// Response format
{
  response: "AI response",
  insights: ["Insight 1", "Insight 2"],
  suggested_questions: ["Question 1", "Question 2"],
  requires_clarification: boolean
}
```

## Styling

- **Color Scheme**: Dark theme with cyan/blue accents
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts with proper hierarchy
- **Spacing**: Consistent padding and margins
- **Effects**: Glassmorphism, gradients, and shadows
